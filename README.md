# BEV-simulation
This model is used to simulate the energy consumption of electric vehicles under the WLTP/Real driving cycle.

The model can simulate：

(1) vehicle longitudinal control

(2) Vehicle range under different working conditions

(3) Feedback brake energy recovery system

The model includes four major sub-modules：

(1) PID Driver Model

(2) Vehicle control system model

(3) Vehicle longitudinal dynamics model

(4) Environmetn modlue
